AS = Auto Safety

## Introduction
1_1. What is ASS?

At relatively high speeds, an autonomous vehicle should able react intelligently. ASS is a safety control system that helps prevent collision for autonomous vehicle on public roadways.

1_2. What does [name] do?

ASS will prevent auto collisions with safe lane changing capabilities. This project is coded with C in an Arduino IDE, and is meant to prove the concept with smale-scale robotic vehicles.

1_3. What does [name] require?

ASS requires an microcontroller and ZUMO shield on an robotic vehicle. In addition, this project requires a distance sensor, reflectance sensor, and dual motor drivers. For software uploading, the Arduino IDE will be used.

Microcontrollers can be used with Arduino, A-Star Prime, or Freescale boards.
